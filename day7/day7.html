<h2><u>PROJECT NAME</u>:<em>Phishing url detection</em>:A Real Case Scenario through Login <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr></h2>
<h2><u>PROJECT DETAILS</u></h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<q><cite>Phishing</cite> is a social engineering <b>cyberattack </b>where criminals deceive users to obtain their <i>credentials</i> through a login form that submits the data to a <i>malicious</i>server. In this paper, we compare <i>machine learning</i> and <i>deep learning</i> techniques to present a method capable of detecting phishing websites through URL analysis. In most current state-of-the-art solutions dealing with phishing detection, the legitimate class is made up of homepages without including login forms. On the contrary, we use URLs from the login page in both classes because we consider it is much more representative of a real case scenario and we demonstrate that existing techniques obtain a high false-positive rate when tested with URLs from legitimate login pages.</q></p>

<h2><u>PROJECT NAME</u>:Predicting hot events in the early period through Bayesian model for social networks</h2>
<h2><u>PROJECT DETAILS</u></h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<q><cite>Predicting emerging hot events</cite> in an early stage is essential for various applications, including information dissemination mining, ads recommendation and etc. Existing techniques either require a long-term observation over the event or features that are expensive to extract. However, given limited data at the early stage of an emerging event, the temporal features of hot events and non-hot events are not distinctive enough yet. In this work, we introduce <abbr title="Bayesian perspective Of Early stage Event Prediction model">BEEP</abbr>, that tackles this dilemma. We formulate the hot event prediction problem by two<b> Semi-Naive Bayes</b>. Classifiers, where we consider both the <em>temporal features</em> and <em>structural features</em> and perform distribution test for the <em>selected features</em>. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations on two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods</q>.</p>
